# HomeDefense - The Runup to War

This is the Github repo for `HomeDefense - The Runup to War`.  This is an early alpha release.  I primarily built it to make it easier to share with people.  

## Running

Go to the `Releases` tab, find the latest release and look for the `Assets` section. Open it up and download the jar file.
